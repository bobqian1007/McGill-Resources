\section{Lecture 1 \textit{<2017-09-12 Tue>}}
\label{sec:orge586dd3}
This course is an introduction to the foundations and paradigms of programming languages.
\begin{itemize}
\item 5 assignments, 5\% each
\item 10\% midterm
\item 65\% final
\item You have two late days for the semester (cumulative)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Four main goals of COMP 302}
\label{sec:org0dc37ba}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide thorough introduction to fundamental concepts in programming languages
\begin{itemize}
\item Higher-order functions
\item State-full vs state-free computation (most languages like Java we've seen are state-full)
\item Modeling objects and closures
\item Exceptions to defer control
\item Continuations to defer control
\item Polymorphism
\item Partial evaluation
\item Lazy programming
\item Modules
\item Etc.
\item Want to explore these concepts so you can recognize them in another language you study at some point
\end{itemize}
\item Show different ways to reason about programs
\begin{itemize}
\item Type checking
\begin{itemize}
\item One of the best inventions
\item Checks what it expects and will actually tell you where it expects something
\item Program is more likely to be correct now
\end{itemize}
\item Induction
\begin{itemize}
\item Proving a program/transformation correct
\end{itemize}
\item Operational semantics
\begin{itemize}
\item How a program is executed
\end{itemize}
\item QuickCheck
\end{itemize}
\item Introduce fundamental principles in programming language design
\begin{itemize}
\item Grammars
\item Parsing
\item Operational semantics and interpreters
\item Type checking
\item Polymorphism
\item Subtyping
\end{itemize}
\item Expose students to a different way of thinking about problems
\begin{itemize}
\item It's like going to the gym; it's good for you!
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{How we achieve these goals}
\label{sec:orga956736}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional programming in OCaml
\begin{itemize}
\item Equal playing field
\begin{itemize}
\item No one in the class really knows it, not affected by performance in previous classes like 250
\end{itemize}
\item Allows us to explain and model object-oriented and imperative programming
\begin{itemize}
\item Isolates lots of the concepts individually
\end{itemize}
\item Isolates concepts such as state-full vs state-free, modules and functions, etc.
\item Statically typed language enforces disciplined programming
\begin{itemize}
\item Also demonstrates that types are an important maintenance tool
\end{itemize}
\item Easy to reason about runtime behavior and cost
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Guiding Principles}
\label{sec:orgb554c4b}
\begin{itemize}
\item No point in learning a programming language unless it changes how you view programming
\item Simple and elegant solutions are more effective, but harder to find than the complicated ones, take more time.
\begin{itemize}
\item You spend very little time testing OCaml code and more time compiling it
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why do I need to know this}
\label{sec:org2aad2ec}
\begin{itemize}
\item Science and craft of programming
\item Skills you learn will help you become a better programmer
\begin{itemize}
\item More productive
\item Code easier to maintain and read
\item Etc.
\end{itemize}
\item Will be needed in some upper level courses
\begin{itemize}
\item Like compilers, etc.
\end{itemize}
\item It is cool and fun!
\item You might even get a job!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assignments}
\label{sec:org35fdabe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can do assignments in groups of 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Misc}
\label{sec:orgfcd69b0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lectures won't be recorded.
\item Slides may or may not be posted, but there are lecture notes on MyCourses (most essential reading)
\end{itemize}
\section{Lecture 2 \textit{<2017-09-14 Thu>}}
\label{sec:orgb317de3}
\subsection{What is OCaml}
\label{sec:orgb26159b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Statically typed functional programming language
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Statically typed}
\label{sec:orgcc07cfe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Types approximate runtime behavior
\item Analyze programs before executing them
\item Find a fix bugs before testing
\item Tries to rule out bad scenarios
\item Very efficient, very good error messages, very good maintenance tool
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Functional}
\label{sec:org4c38d21}
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary expressions are functions!
\item Functions are first-class!
\begin{itemize}
\item Not only can we return base types like ints, we can return functions and pass them as arguments too
\item One of the key features of functional languages
\end{itemize}
\item Pure vs Not Pure languages
\begin{itemize}
\item Haskell is Pure
\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't give you ways to allocate memory or directly modify memory
\end{itemize}
\item OCaml is impure
\begin{itemize}
\item Has arrays and consequences and stuff
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Call-By-Value vs Lazy
\begin{itemize}
\item OCaml is call by value
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Concepts for Today}
\label{sec:orgcf278af}
\begin{itemize}
\item Writing and executing basic expressions
\item Learn how to read error messages
\item Names
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{OCaml demo in class}
\label{sec:org813514e}
\begin{itemize}
\item Always have to finish a line with 2 semi colons ;;
\item Can use interpreter by launching OCaml in shell
\item Functional good for parallel computing
\item Good to reason about these programs
\item int: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 ;;
\item 1+3;;
\end{itemize}
\item Strings: 
\begin{itemize}
\item "Hello";;
\end{itemize}
\item Floats:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3.14;;
\end{itemize}
\item Booleans:
\begin{itemize}
\item true;;
\end{itemize}
\item if
\begin{itemize}
\item if 0=0 then 1.4 else 2.1 ;;
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Operators
\label{sec:org58436af}
\begin{itemize}
\item +, -, /, *
\begin{itemize}
\item Take as input 2 int, return int
\end{itemize}
\item 3.14 + 1 ;; \(\to\) error
\item To specify for floating point operators, follow by a dot. Only works with floating points, no ints
\begin{itemize}
\item 3.14 +. 2.4 ;;
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Types
\label{sec:orgbe859a2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Approximate the runtime behaviour
\item Types classify expressions according to the value they will compute
\item Won't execute right away, will think of types you are returning to see if it's valid
\item if 0=0 then 1.4 else 3 ;; 
\begin{itemize}
\item Error, after reading 1.4 expects 3 to be float
\end{itemize}
\item if bool then T else T
\begin{itemize}
\item Both Ts have to be the same type
\end{itemize}
\item Type checker will allow 1/0;; to run, but will have a runtime exception
\begin{itemize}
\item int/int is not enough info to know that your dividing by 0
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Vars
\label{sec:orga14a7d3}
\begin{itemize}
\item let pi = 3.14 ;;
\item let (pi : float) = 3.14 ;;
\item let m = 3 in
\begin{itemize}
\item let n=m * m in
\item let k=m*m in
\item k*n ;;
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Binding
\label{sec:org8cdca28}
\begin{itemize}
\item let m = 3 ;; puts it on the stack
\item let m = 3 in \ldots{}
\begin{itemize}
\item m is a local variable now (temporary binding), once you hit ;;, won't have m anymore
\item Garbage collector
\end{itemize}
\item let x (name of a variable) = exp in \uline{exp} (x is bound to this expression)
\item variables are bind to values, not assigned values
\begin{itemize}
\item they look in the past!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Functions
\label{sec:org0c3c493}
\begin{itemize}
\item let area = function r -> pi *. r * .r;;
\begin{itemize}
\item Syntax error
\end{itemize}
\item let area = function r -> pi *. r *. r ;;
\item let area r = pi *. r *. r ;;
\item let a4 = area (2.0);;
\item If you redefine pi, like let pi = 6.0 ;;
\item area(2.0) will still give you the same thing
\item The function looks up in the past

\item Stack:
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
 & \\
\hline
pi & 6.0\\
area & function r -> p *. r *. r\\
k & 5\\
k & 4\\
pi & 3.14\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can redefine the function though
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Lecture 3 \textit{<2017-09-15 Fri>}}
\label{sec:org2dd1e1e}
\subsection{Functions}
\label{sec:org0c05d08}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functions are values
\item Function names establish a binding of the function name to its body
\begin{itemize}
\item let area (r:float)=pi*. r *. r ;;
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Recursive functions}
\label{sec:org6bd782f}
Recursive functions are declared using the keyword \uline{let rec}
\begin{itemize}
\item let rec fact n =
\begin{itemize}
\item if m = 0 them 1
\begin{itemize}
\item else n*face(n-1)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item fact 2 needs to be stored on the stack
\item fact 2 -> 2* fact 1
\item fact 1 -> 1* fact 0 stored on stack
\item fact 0 = 1
\item Need to remember computation when you come back out of recursion, so need to store on the stack
\begin{itemize}
\item What's the solution to this? How is functional programming efficient?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tail-recursive functions
\label{sec:org18d8685}
A function is said to be "tail-recursive", if there is nothing to do except return the final value. Since the execution of the function is done, saving its stack frame (i.e. where we remember the work we still in general need to do), is redundant
\begin{itemize}
\item Write efficient code
\item All recursive functions can be translated into tail-recursive form
\end{itemize}
\item Ex. Rewrite Factorial
\label{sec:org9914ed1}
\begin{itemize}
\item let rec fact\_tr n =
\begin{itemize}
\item let rec f(n,m) -
\begin{itemize}
\item if n=0 then
\begin{itemize}
\item m
\end{itemize}
\item else f(n-1,n*m)
\end{itemize}
\item in
\begin{itemize}
\item f(n,1)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Second parameter to accumulate the results in the base case we simply return its result

\item Avoids having to return a value from the recursive call and subsequently doing further computation

\item Avoids building up a runtime stack to memorize what needs to be done once the recursive call returns a value

\item f(2,1) -> fact(1, 2*1) -> fact(0,2)-> 2

\item Whoever uses the function does not need to know how the function works, so you can use this more efficient way in the background

\item What is the type of fact\_tr? fact\_tr: int(input) \(\to\) int(output)

\item Type of f? f: int * int (tuple input) \(\to\) int

\begin{itemize}
\item n-tuples don't need to be of the same type, can have 3 different types, like int*bool*string
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Passing arguments}
\label{sec:orgd912dcc}
\begin{itemize}
\item ' means any type, i.e. 'a
\item All args at same time
\begin{itemize}
\item 'a*'b -> 'c
\end{itemize}
\item One argument at a time
\begin{itemize}
\item 'a -> 'b -> 'c
\item May not have a and b at the same time. Once it has both it will get c.
\end{itemize}
\item We can translate any function from one to the other type, called currying (going all at once to one at a time) and uncurrying (opposite).
\begin{itemize}
\item Will see in 2 weeks
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data Types and Pattern Matching}
\label{sec:org9f3ced9}
\subsubsection{Playing cards}
\label{sec:orge21fbb2}
\begin{itemize}
\item How can we model a collection of cards?
\item Declare a new type together with its elements
\item type suit = Clubs | Spades | Hearts | Diamonds
\begin{itemize}
\item Called a user-defined (non-recursive) data type
\item Order of declaration does not matter
\begin{itemize}
\item Like a set
\end{itemize}
\item We call clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds constructors (or constants), also called elements of this type
\begin{itemize}
\item \uline{Constructors} must begin with a \uline{capital letter} in OCaml
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Use \uline{pattern matching} to analyze elements of a given type.
\item match <expression> with
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
<pattern> -> <expression>\\
<pattern> -> <expression>\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\ldots{}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
<pattern> -> <expression>\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}
A pattern is either a variable or a \ldots{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Statements checked in order
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Comparing suits
\label{sec:org40e3eda}
Write a function dom of type suit*suit -> bool
\begin{itemize}
\item dom(s1,s2) = true iff suit s1 beats or is equal to suit s2 relative to the ordering Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs
\item (Spades, \_) means Spades and anything
\item (s1, s2) -> s1=s2 will return the result of s1=s2
\item Compiler gives you warning if it's not exhaustive and tells you some that aren't matched
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Lecture 4 \textit{<2017-09-19 Tue>}}
\label{sec:org4649864}
\subsection{Data Types and Pattern Matching Continued}
\label{sec:orga11788f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type is unordered
\item type suit = Clubs | Spades | Hearts | Diamonds
\begin{itemize}
\item Order doesn't matter here, but they must start with capitals
\end{itemize}
\item type rank = Two | Three | \ldots{}
\item type card = rank * suit
\end{itemize}
What is a hand? A hand is either empty or if c is a card and h is a hand then Hand(c,h). Nothing else is a hand. Hand is a constructor. hand is a type. (capitalization mattersA)
\begin{itemize}
\item Recursive user defined data type
\item Inductive or recursive definition of a hand
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a card to something that is a hand, still a hand
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Recursive data type}
\label{sec:orgded2258}
\begin{itemize}
\item type hand = Empty | Hand of card * hand
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Typing into interpreter
\label{sec:org6e95789}
\begin{itemize}
\item Empty;;
\begin{itemize}
\item hand = Empty
\end{itemize}
\item let h1 = Hand ((Ace, Spades),Empty);;
\begin{itemize}
\item Want only 1 card, so include empty
\item Recursive data type, so it needs another hand in it
\end{itemize}
\item let h2 = Hand ((Queen, Hearts), Hand((Ace,Spades), Empty);;
\begin{itemize}
\item Recursive
\end{itemize}
\item let h3 = Hand ((Joker, Hearts), h2) ;;
\begin{itemize}
\item Error, Joker not defined
\end{itemize}
\item type 'a list = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a list
\item Hand ((Queen, Hearts), (King, Spades), (Three, Diamonds));;
\begin{itemize}
\item Hand has type? card * card * card
\item Get an error, because constructor Hand expects 2 arguments (card+hand)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Extract Example}
\label{sec:orgf2a136a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a hand, extract all cards of a certain suit
\item extract: suit -> hand -> hand
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
let rec extract (s:suit) (h:hand) = match h with
  | Empty -> Empty (* We are constructing results, not destructing given hand *)
  (* Want to extract suit from first card *)
  | Hand ( (r0.s0) ,h) -> 
     (*Make a hand with first card and remaining results of recursive ext*)
     if s0 = s then Hand( (r0, s0), extract s h0)
     else extract s h0
\end{verbatim}
Hand is "destroyed" through this method, but old hand stays the same, it is not modified.
\begin{itemize}
\item Running extract Spades hand5;; will give a new hand with only spades
\item Good exercise, write a function that counts how many cards in the hand
\item Can we make this thing tail recursive?
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
let rec extract' (s:suit) (h:hand) acc = match h with
  | Empty -> acc (* Accumulator *)
  (* Want to extract suit from first card *)
  | Hand ( (r0.s0) ,h) -> 
     (*Make a hand with first card and remaining results of recursive ext*)
     if s0 = s then extract' s h0 (Hand( (r0, s0), acc))
     else extract' s h0 acc
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item extract' Spades hand5 Empty ;;
\item Gives same cards but in the reverse order of extract
\item extract Spades hand5 = extract' Spades hand5 Empty ;;
\begin{itemize}
\item False
\end{itemize}

\item Write a function find which when given a rank and a hand, finds the first card in hand of the specified rank and returns its corresponding suit.
\end{itemize}
What if no card exists?
\begin{itemize}
\item Optional Data Type (predefined)
\item type 'a option = None | Some of 'a
\end{itemize}
\section{Lecture 5 \textit{<2017-09-21 Thu>}}

\item\relax [] is an \('\alpha\) list
\begin{itemize}
\item Given an element x of type \('\alpha\) and l of type \('\alpha\) list
\item[{x}] l is an \('\alpha\) list (i.e. a list containing elements of type \('\alpha\))
\end{itemize}
\item ; are syntactical sugar to separate elements of a list
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Execution}
\label{sec:org6566326}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Operational Semantics}
\end{itemize}
\section{Lecture 6 \textit{<2017-09-22 Fri>}}
\label{sec:orgd39550a}
\subsection{Proofs}
\label{sec:orgd9eb65d}
\subsubsection{Demo: lookup \& insert}
\label{sec:org98bd19f}
\begin{verbatim}
(* Warm up *)
(* Write a function lookup: 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> 'b option. 
Given a key k of type 'a and a list l of key-value pairs, 
return the corresponding value v in l (if it exists). *)
(* lookup : 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> 'b option  *)
let rec lookup k l = match l with
  | [] -> None
  | (k',v')::t -> if k=k' then Some v' (* If it is the right key, return val*)
		  else lookup k t;;

(* Write a function insert which
given a key k and a value v and an ordered list l of type ('a * 'b) list
it inserts the key-value pair (k,v) into the list l 
preserving the order (ascending keys). *)
(* insert : ('a * 'b) -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a * 'b) list 
 insert (k,v) l = l'

 Precondition: l is ordered.

Postcondition: l' is also ordered and we inserted (k,v) at the right position in l*)

(* let rec insert (k,v) l = match l with
 *   | [] -> [(k,v)]
 *         (\* k = k' or k < k' or k' < k *\)
 *   | ((k',v') as h) :: t ->
 *      if k = k' then (k,v) :: l
 *      else
 *        if k' < k then (k,v) :: l
 *        else h :: insert (k,v) t;;
 * 
 * let l = [(1,"anne") ; (7,"di")];;
 * l;;
 * let l0 = insert (3,"bob") l;;
 * insert (3,"tom") l0 ;;
 * (\* But now we'll have 2 entries with the same key *\) *)
(* Undesirable, better to replace the value if its a dictionary*)

let rec insert (k,v) l = match l with
  | [] -> [(k,v)]
	(* k = k' or k < k' or k' < k *)
  | ((k',v') as h) :: t ->
     if k = k' then (k,v) :: t (* Replace *)
     else
       if k' < k then (k,v) :: l
       else h :: insert (k,v) t;;

(* Personal tail recursive attempt *)
let insert_t (k,v) l =
  let rec insert_acc (k,v) l acc = match l with
    | [] -> acc @ [(k,v)]
    | ((k',v') as h) :: t ->
       if k = k' then (k,v) :: t
       else
	 if k' < k then (k,v) :: l
	 else insert_acc (k,v) t (acc @ [h])
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the relationship between lookup and insert?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{How to prove it?}
\label{sec:org7e9b657}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Step 1
\label{sec:org2ad97ec}
We need to understand how programs are executed (operational semantics)
\begin{itemize}
\item \(e \Downarrow v\) expression \(e\) evaluates in multiple steps to the value \(v\). (\textbf{Big-Step})
\item \(e \Rightarrow e'\) expression \(ee\) evaluates in one steps to expression \(e'\). (\textbf{Small-Step (single)})
\item \(e \implies^* e'\) expression \(e\) evaluates in multiple steps to expression \(e'\) (\textbf{Small-Step (multiple)})
\end{itemize}

For all l, v, k, lookup k (insert k v l) \(\implies *\) Some v
Induction on what?
\item Step 2
\label{sec:org6b42315}
\(P(l) = lookup k\) (insert\((k,v) l\)) \(\Downarrow\) Some \(v\)
\begin{itemize}
\item How to reason inductively about lists?
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze their structure!
\item The recipe \ldots{}
\item To prove a property \(P(l)\) holds about a list \(l\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Base Case: \(l = []\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Show \(P([])\) holds
\end{itemize}
\item Step Case: \(l=x::xs\)
\begin{itemize}

\label{sec:org231e715}
(You get points on an exam for mentioning what kind of induction, structural induction on tree, points for base case/case, points for stating induction hypothesis, perhaps multiple. Then show by a sequence of steps of how to get from what to show to the end)
\begin{itemize}
\item Case t = Empty

\subsection{Higher-order functions}
\label{sec:orge220cfd}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allows us to abstract over common functionality
\item Programs can be very short and compact
\item Very reusable, well-structured, modular
\item Each significant piece implemented in one place
\item Functions are first-class values!
\begin{itemize}
\item Pass functions as arguments (today)
\item Return them as results (next week)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Abstracting over common functionality}
\label{sec:orgc1fdba2}
Want to write a recursive function that sums up over an integer range: \(\sum_{k=a}^{k=b}k\)

\begin{verbatim}
let rec sum (a,b) =
if a > b then 0 else a + sum(a+1,b)
\end{verbatim}

Now what if we want to make a sum of squares? \(\sum_{k=a}^{k=b}k^2\)

\begin{verbatim}
let rec sum (a,b) =
if a > b then 0 else square(a) + sum(a+1,b)
\end{verbatim}

\(\sum_{k=a}^{k=b}2^k\)

\begin{verbatim}
let rec sum (a,b) =
if a > b then 0 else exp(2,a) + sum(a+1,b)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item So you can reimplement the function every time, but it would be more useful to make a sum function that will sum up what you tell it to (what to do to each element)
\item Non-Generic Sum (old)
\begin{itemize}
\item int * int -> int
\end{itemize}
\item Generic Sum using a function as an argument
\begin{itemize}
\item (int -> int) -> int * int -> int
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demo}

let sumCubes' (a,b) = sum cube(a,b);;

(* let sumExp' (a,b) = sum exp2(a,b);; *)
let sumExp' (a,b) = sum (fun x-> exp (2,x)) (a,b);;

(* Inconvenient, we have to define a function beforehand *)
(* How can we define a function on the fly without naming it?
 -> Use anonymous functions*)

(* Different ways to make anonymous functions *)
fun x y -> x + y;;
function x -> x;;
fun x -> x;;
(* Can use function for pattern matching 
 Don't need to write match
 Function can only take in one argument and implies pattern matching
 fun can take many *)
(function 0 -> 0 | n -> n+1);;
(* Equivalent to fun and match *)
(fun x -> match x with 0 -> 0 | n -> n+1);;


(* comb: is how we combine - either * or + 
 f : is what we do to the a
 inc : is how we increment a to get to b
 base : is what we return when a > b *)
(* Make this tail recursive this time  *)
let rec series comb f (a,b) inc base =
  if a > b then base
  else series comb f (inc(a),b) inc (comb base (f a));;
(* Base acts as an accumulator *)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item How about only summing up odd numbers?
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
let rec sumOdd (a,b) =
if (a mod 2) = 1 then 
sum (fun x -> x) (a, b)
else 
sum (fun x -> x)(a+1, b)
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Adding increment function
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
let rec sum f (a, b) inc =
if (a > b) then 0 else (f a) + sum f (inc(a), b) inc


let rec sumOdd (a,b) =
if (a mod 2) = 1 then 
sum (fun x -> x) (a, b) (fun x -> x+1)
else 
sum (fun x -> x)(a+1, b) (fun x-> x+1)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item How about only multiplying?
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
let rec product f (a, b) inc =
if (a > b) then 1 else (f a) * product f (inc(a), b) inc
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can make this tail recursive with accumulators for base (1 for prod, 0 for sum)
\end{itemize}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Types: 
\begin{itemize}
\item (int -> int -> int) : comb

\item series: -> (int -> int) : f

\item int * int : a,b lower and upper bound

\item int -> int : inc

\item int : base
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Types can get crazy, too much abstraction may lead to less readability
\subsection{Bonus}
\label{sec:orga125087}
Approximating the integral
\begin{itemize}
\item \(l = a + dx/2\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Use rectangles to approximate
\item Left side of l is above the rectangle, right side is below, approximation should almost cancel them
\item \(\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx f(l)*dx + f(l+dx)*dx+f(l+dx+dx)*dx+\ldots =dx * (f(l)+f(l+dx)+f(l+2*dx)+f(l+3*dx) \ldots)\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Want: sum: \(\underbrace{(float -> float)}_f -> (\underbrace{float}_l * \underbrace{float}_u) -> \underbrace{(float -> float)}_{inc} -> float\)

\begin{verbatim}
let integral f (a,b) dx =
dx * sum f (a+.(dx/2.),b) (fun x-> x+. dx)

\begin{itemize}
\item type is int * int -> int
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item What are types?
\begin{itemize}
\item Base types: Int, float, string\ldots{}
\item If T is a type and S is a type then
\begin{itemize}
\item T->S is a type
\item T*S is a type
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Curry}
\label{sec:orgd0a53a9}
let curry \(\underbrace{f}_{\text{'a * 'b -> 'c}}= fun \underbrace{x}_{\text{'a}}  \underbrace{y}_{\text{'b}} \text{ -> } f \overbrace{(x, y)}^{\text{'a * b}}_{\text{'a -> 'b -> 'c}}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item curry \(\underbrace{plus'}_{\text{int * int -> int}}\): int -> int -> int
\item fun x y -> plus' (x,y)
\begin{itemize}
\item OCaml gives you <fun>
\item Shouldn't we continue evaluation plus'(x,y) and get as a final result fun x y -> x + y?
\begin{itemize}
\item No, we never evaluate inside function bodies
\item When OCaml sees fun, it stops looking
\begin{itemize}
\item It has a function, it's a value, it's done
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Uncurrying}
\label{sec:org6a6e115}
uncurry ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a * 'b -> 'c
\begin{itemize}
\item The type of functions is \uline{right associative}
\item \textbf{NOT} the same thing as 'a -> 'b -> 'c -> 'a * 'b -> 'c
\item \textbf{Important} to know how to read functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Ex. plus function from earlier
\item Can also have plus x = fun y -> x + y
\begin{itemize}
\item int -> (int -> int)
\item Makes a function from an int
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Demo}
\label{sec:orgd6dacf7}
We've already seen functions that return other functions: derivatives!
\begin{verbatim}
(* Write a function curry that takes as input 
 * a function f:('a * 'b)->c' 
 * and returns as a result a function
 * 'a->'b->'c*)

(* curry : (('a * 'b)->'c)-> 'a -> 'b -> 'c 
 * Note: Arrows are right-associative. *)
let curry f = (fun x y -> f (x,y))

let curry_version2 f x y = f (x,y)

let curry_version3 = fun f -> fun x -> fun y -> f (x,y)

						  (* Uncurry *)
						  (* uncurry ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a * 'b -> 'c *)
let uncurry f = (fun (x,y) -> f x y)

(* swap : ('a * 'b -> 'c) -> 'b * 'a -> 'c *)
let swap f = fun (b, a) -> f(a , b)                  

let plus' (x,y) = x + y

(* swap plus' ===> fun (b,a) -> plus' (a,b) *)
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Partial evaluation}
\label{sec:org59555b0}
\begin{itemize}
\item A technique for optimizing and specializing programs
\item Generate programs from other programs
\item Produce new programs which run faster than originals and guaranteed to behave in same way
\item What is the result of evaluation curry plus'?
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\implies\) It's a function!
\item Result: fun x y -> plus' x y
\begin{itemize}
\item Still waiting for x y
\item What if we just pass in 3? (plus 3)
\begin{itemize}
\item fun y -> 3 + y
\item We generated a function!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item let plusSq x y = \(\underbrace{x * x}_{horriblyExpensiveThing(x)}\) + y
\begin{itemize}
\item fun y -> 3 * 3 + y (if we set x as 3), won't evaluate this expensive function until we give it a y
\item If we write:
\begin{itemize}
\item plusSq 3 10
\item plusSq 3 15
\item plusSq 3 20
\end{itemize}
\item We'd have to evaluate horribly expensive function 3 times.
\item Why not store it and use it for the next computation?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\#+BEGIN\_SRC ocaml
let betterPlusSq x =
	let x = horriblyExpensiveThing(x)
		in fun y -> x + y
\#+END\_SRC ocaml 
\begin{itemize}
\item Now we get:
\item let x = horriblyExpensiveThing 3 in fun y -> x+y -> fun y ->9+y
\begin{itemize}
\item Now we can use this function to quickly compute without having to do the expensive function
\item Partial evaluation is very important
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Midterm Review}
\label{sec:org4b99132}
See either 13.ml or Midterm.ml for the questions.
\section{Lecture 14 \textit{<2017-10-13 Fri>}}
\label{sec:org1746188}
How can we do imperative programming (like C) in a functional language?
\begin{itemize}
\item So far, expressions in OCaml have:
\begin{itemize}
\item An expression has a type
\item Expression evaluates to a value (or diverges)
\end{itemize}
\item Today:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expressions in OCaml may also have an effect (one effect is allocating values to memory and updating them)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Overshadowing}
\label{sec:org77f8650}
Recall: 
\begin{verbatim}
let (k : int) = 4;;
let (k : int) = 3 in k * k;;
k;; (* This will be 4! *)
\end{verbatim}
Binding in line 2 will be gone after line 2.
\begin{verbatim}
let pi = 3.14;;
let area (r:float) = pi *. r *. r;;

let a2 = area (2.0)

let (pi : float) = 6.0;;

let b1 = area (2.0) = a2 (* True *)

let area (r:float) = pi *. r *. r;;
let b2 = area (2.0) = a2 (* False *)
\end{verbatim}
For b1, calling area will use the old definition of pi (it already evaluated it when we created the function).
\subsection{State}
\label{sec:org0a24da0}
How to program with state? We may want to update memory, for example if we have values that change or an array.
\begin{itemize}
\item How to allocate state?
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
let x = ref 0
\end{verbatim}
Allocates a reference cell with the name x in memory and initializes it with 0. Not the address, cannot do address manipulation.
\begin{itemize}
\item How to compare 2 reference cells?
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare their address: \texttt{r == s}
\begin{itemize}
\item Succeeds if both are names for the same location in memory.
\end{itemize}
\item Compare their content: \texttt{r = s}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
let x = ref 0
let y = ref 0
x = y (*true*)
x==y (*false*)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to read value stored in a reference cell?
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{!x}
\item \texttt{let \{contents = x\} = r}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pattern match on value that is stored in the reference cell with name x
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item How to update value stored?
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{x := 3}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Demo}
\label{sec:org0aae5b1}
\begin{verbatim}
let r = ref 0;;
let s = ref 0;;
r = s;; (* True *)
r == s;; (* False *)
r := 3;;
(* Update, but it returns a unit, uninteresting
 * Always true, what it says is it succeeded
 * As an effect, it changes the value in cell x.
 * But the _value_ of updating a cell is 
 * (). unit is type, it evaluates to ()
 * Keep this in mind*)
!r;;
let x = !r + !s;; (* 3 *)

(* The following is not valid: *)
(* r := 3.4;; *)
(* This is because r is an int ref *)

r := !s;;
!r;;

r := 2+3;; (*2+3 evaluated before stored*)
!r;;

(* What's the value of r? (_IMPORTANT_)
 * The address/location in memory 
 * So t = r will set t to the same address *)
let t = r;; (* Point to same loc in mem*)
t == r;;
t := 4 * 3;;
!t;;
!r;;

(* Polymorphic functions, will see later *)
let id = ref (fun x -> x);;
id := fun x -> x + 1;;
(* Will fix x to an int *)
(* This won't work: *)
(* id := fun x -> x +. 3.2;; *)

(* Can only do something like *)
id := fun x -> x + 2;;
(* Can also overshadow references *)
let id = ref (fun x -> x + 1);;

(* Back to the area example *)
let pi = ref 3.14;;
let area r = !pi *. r *. r;;

let a2 = area (2.0);; (*12.56*)
pi := 6.0;;
let a3 = area (2.0);; (*24.0*) 
a2 = a3;; (* false *)

(* Now we can write C like
 *   programs using references *)

(* Purely functional, 
 * changes addresses in triple *)
let rot (a,b,c) = (c,b,a);;

(* Purely rotten, 
 * changes contents in triple *)
let rott (a,b,c) = let t = !a in (a := !c ; c := t ; (a,b,c)) ;;

let triple = (ref 1, ref 2, ref 3);;
rot triple;;
rott triple;;
(* They don't both do the same thing,
 * since one changes addresses vs contents *)


(*Imperative factorial
 * More complicated than purely functional ver
 * Considered bad style in functional
 * Harder to reason about its correctness 
 * Harder to understand*)
let imperative_fact n =
  begin
    let result = ref 1 in
    let i = ref 0 in
    let rec loop () =
      if !i = n then ()
      else (i := !i + 1; result := !result * !i; loop ())
    in
    (loop (); !result)
  end
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item Updating a cell in memory has
\begin{itemize}
\item a value (i.e. unit, written in OCaml as \texttt{()})
\item an effect (i.e. changes the value in cell x)
\end{itemize}
\item Types
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{let r = ref 0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type of r: int ref
\item ref 0 is an int ref
\item 0 is an int
\item We cannot store a float in r
\item \texttt{!r} is an int
\item For \texttt{r:=3+2} to make sense, r should be an int ref and 3+2 must be an int. This returns a type of unit.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Given the following expression write down its type, its value (i.e. what the expression evaluates to), and its effect, if it has any.
\begin{itemize}
\item Usually on exams, they should all type check. The error option is just in case they make a typo in typing the question.
\item \texttt{3+2}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{('a list -> bool) * float}
\item \texttt{(<fun>,6.4)}
\item No effect
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = ref 3 in x := !x + 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: \texttt{let k=1 in k+2} is an int, and \texttt{k=1} gets discarded after \texttt{k+2}
\item \texttt{unit}
\item \texttt{()}
\item Effect? No, x is disposed of. Removed from the stack after evaluation in this example. x is now unbound
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{fun x -> x := 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{int ref -> unit}
\item \texttt{<fun>}
\item Effect: updated x to 3
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{(fun x -> x := 3) y}
\begin{itemize}
\item type: unit
\item value: ()
\item Effect: updated y to 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backtracking}
\label{sec:orgb5ec7b3}
\begin{itemize}
\item General algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions incrementally - abandons partial candidates as soon as it determines that it cannot lead to a successful solution
\item Important tool to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as crosswords, puzzles, Sudoku, etc.
\item Ex today:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement a function \texttt{change}. It takes as input a list of available coins and an amount \texttt{amt}. It returns the exact change for the amount (i.e. a list of available coins, \texttt{[c1;c2;...;cn]} such that \texttt{c1 + c2 + ... + cn = amt}), if possible; otherwise it raises an exception \texttt{Change}.

Backtracking with exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given \texttt{change[6,5,2] 9}
\item \texttt{try 6::change[6;5;2] 3 with Change -> change [5;2] 9}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{change [5;2] 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{change[2] 3}
\item \texttt{try 2::change[2] 1} will not work, raise Change and get back to \texttt{change [5;2] 9} from before
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Key thing to take away is:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can use exceptions for special cases like dividing by 0
\item But a more interesting use is that you can divert control flow
\item So you can use it to backtrack and solve problems

\subsection{Modules}
\label{sec:orgb7b860c}
Primary Benefits:
\begin{itemize}
\item Control complexity of developing and maintaining software
\item Split large programs into separate pieces
\item Name space separation
\item Allows for separate compilation
\begin{itemize}
\item Don't always want to recompile the whole project after a small change
\item Incremental compilation \& type checking
\end{itemize}
\item Incremental development
\item Clear specifications at module boundaries
\item Programs are easier to maintain and reuse (!)
\item Enforces abstractions
\item Isolates bugs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Signatures (Module Types)}
\label{sec:orgb2bb7f3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Declarations can be more specific in the signature than what the module actually implements
\item Tying a module to a module type we are hiding information!
\begin{itemize}
\item We can change the module implementation in the future and users won't notice as long as it still implements what we specified in the signature
\end{itemize}
\item Order of signature doesn't have to have the same order as module
\end{itemize}

    let stack2list(s:stack) = s
  end

\label{sec:org8d77b0f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can hide information when we bind to a module type
\item Don't expose how we implement it
\item Can even hide what elements we store in the stack
\item Nice level of abstraction, so we can easily rip out the implementation and put in a new one
\item Makes programs easy to maintain
\item Modules are great for enforcing abstraction

(* All these currencies use the same implementation of float,

\subsection{Continuations}
\label{sec:orgb90f869}
A \textbf{continuation} is a representation of the execution state of a program (for example a call stack) at a certain point in time.

Save the current state of execution into some object and restore the state from this object at a later point in time resuming its execution.
\subsubsection{First-class Support for Continuations}
\label{sec:org91703bb}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
C\# & async/wait\\
Racket & call-with-current-continuation\\
Ruby & callcc\\
Scala & shift/reset\\
Scheme & callcc\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Ocaml doesn't have first-class support, so we'll be using functions as continuations! Back to higher order functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Back to the beginning: Recall what tail-recursive means. Can every recursive function be written tail-recursively?
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
let rec append l k = match l with
  | [] -> k
  | h::t -> h::append t k
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not tail-recursive, because of \texttt{h::append t k}
\item But still efficient
\item Can we rewrite it tail-recursively?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Recipe}
\label{sec:orgacaa35e}
How to re-write a function tail-recursively?
\begin{itemize}
\item Add an additional argument, a \textbf{continuation}, which acts like an accumulator
\item In the base case, we call the continuation
\item In the recursive case, we build up the computation that still needs to be done.
\end{itemize}
A continuation is a stack of functions modeling the call stack, i.e. the work we still need to do upon returning.
\begin{itemize}
\item Not always easy to do this, the earlier attempt at tail recursion for append reversed the list.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Demo}
\label{sec:org3863e0f}
\begin{verbatim}
(* append: 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list *)
let rec append l k = match l with
  | [] -> k
  | h::t -> h::(append t k)

(* Tail recursive *)
(* app_tl: 'a list -> 'a list -> ('a list -> 'a list) -> 'a list *)
(* First 'a list in c is "waiting for result" of rec call 
   and last one is final result *)
let rec app_tl l k c = match l with
(* | [] -> ?
 * | h::t -> app_tl t k ? *)
(* How to do this? Need something with a hole, i.e. a function *)
  (* When you do app [1;2] [3;4] ([3;4 = k]) -> 1::app [2] [3;4] 
   * -> 1::2::app [] [3;4] What to give to c here? [3;4]*)
  (* c = (fun r -> 1::2::r) *)
  (* Parameterized function, can call and start using *)
  (* c k -> 1::2::[3,4] *)
  | [] -> c k (* Calling the continuation 
	       - passing to the call stack k*)

  if n > 0 then genList (n-1) (n::acc) else acc;;

let l1 = genList 8000000 [];;
let l2 = genList 4000000 [];;

(* append l1 l2 gives stack overflow*)
(* So does l1 @ l2

 * For short lists, it works faster
 * But it cannot append huge lists like this one
 * Program can crash vs program being a bit slower*)
app_tl l1 l2 (fun r -> r);;

let rec map l f = match l with

  | h::t -> (f h)::map t f

\subsection{Continuation recap}
\label{sec:org25ec0cc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Building up the stack
\item Once you hit base, it collapses
\item Seen an example, tail-recursion: the continuation is a functional accumulator; it represents the call stack built when recursively calling a function and builds the final result
\item Failure Continuation: the continuation keeps track of what to do upon failure and defers control to the continuation
\item Success Continuation: the continuation keeps track of what to do upon success, defers control to the continuation, and builds the final result
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:orga1ebeab}
\subsection{Regular expressions}
\label{sec:org5220684}
Going to implement regex with continuations. This is another example of a success continuation.

You might have used them in a Unix shell:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ls *.ml}, list files with suffix ml
\item \texttt{ls hw[1-3].ml}, lists hw1.ml, hw2.ml, hw3.ml
\end{itemize}
Patterns for regular expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Singleton: Matching a specific character
\item Alternation: choice between two patterns
\item Concatenation: Succession of patterns
\item Iteration: indefinite repetition of patterns
\end{itemize}
More rigorously: Regular expression \(r ::= a | r_1+r_2 | r_1 r_2 | r^* | 0 | 1\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Backus-Naur-Form
\item This is an inductive definition
\item How to read this?
\item A regex is either: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \(a\), a character (anything of type char)
\item \(r_1\ r_2\) is concatenation, have both regular expressions
\item \(r_1 + r_2\) alternation, can have either
\item \(r^*\) iteration, indefinite amount
\item \(0\) None
\item \(1\) Success
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Question: When does a string \(s\) match a regular expression \(r\)?
\begin{itemize}
\item If \(s\) is in the set of terms described by \(r\). (When does this happen?)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Examples:}
\label{sec:org89d08fb}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(a(p^*)l(e+y)\) would match \emph{apple} or \emph{apply} or \emph{ale}
\item \(g(1+r)(e+a)y\), either you succeed (skip it) or find r, \emph{grey},/gray/,/gay/
\item \(g(1+o)^*(gle)\), \emph{google},/gogle/,/goooogle/,/ggle/ (1+o) doesn't matter here, could just be o
\item \(b(ob0+oba)\), \emph{boba} but not bob
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Demo}
\label{sec:orgda08b80}
\begin{verbatim}
(* BNF notation *)
type regexp =
  Char of char | Times of regexp * regexp | One | Zero |
  Plus of regexp * regexp | Star of regexp

   with s1 matching r1 and s2 matching r2
 * Matches r* iff s= empty or s = s1 s2 
   with s1 matching r1 and s2 matches r* *)

(* acc: regexp -> char list (each char that makes up string)

(* acc (Times(r1,r2)) s *)
(* Idea: check if a prefix of s matches r1 *)
(* But we still need to check the remaining part of s with r2 
 * So we pass the whole char list to k *)
(* We use continuations as backtracking, so we don't have to 
   worry about where we split the string *)

  | Char c, [] -> false (* Expected some characters, got nothing *)
  | Char c, c1::s -> (c = c1) && k s (* At the bottom of the stack
					If we succeed, pass rest of string to                                      call stack*)
  | Times (r1, r2), s -> acc r1 s (fun s2 -> acc r2 s2 k)
  (* Can we match remaining string as well?

  | Zero, s -> false
  | Star r, s ->
     (k s) || acc r s (fun s2 -> not (s = s2) && acc (Star r) s2 k)

\item Evaluate expression \texttt{3+2} to the value \texttt{5}
\item Evaluate expression \texttt{x*2} in an environment where variable \texttt{x} is bound to the value \texttt{5} to the final value \texttt{10}
\end{enumerate}
\item Ex. let x = horribleComp (345) in 5
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate expression horribleComp (345) to some value \texttt{777}
\item Evaluate expression \texttt{5} in an environment where variable \texttt{x} is bound to the value \texttt{777} to the final value \texttt{5}. Here we bind an expression we don't need.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\item Lazy Computation
\begin{itemize}
\item Ex. \texttt{let x = horribleComp (345) in 5}
\item Bind variables to unevaluated expressions (not values!)
\item Suspend computation \texttt{horribleComp (345)} until needed
\item Memoize results because:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = horribleComp (345) in x + x} will recompute horribleComp twice
\end{itemize}
\item Lazy usually doesn't go well with state, which is why most imperative languages are eager
\item Harder to reason about but very useful for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Infinite data (ex. representing all prime numbers, reading part of a file instead of the whole thing)
\item Interactive data (ex. sequence or stream of inputs)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Finite vs Infinite}
\label{sec:org16bf2b1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finite Data
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{type 'a list = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a list}
\begin{itemize}
\item Encodes an inductive definition of finite lists
\item \texttt{Nil} is a list of type \texttt{'a list}
\item If \texttt{x} is of type \texttt{'a} and \texttt{xs} is a list of type \texttt{'a list} then \texttt{cons(x,xs)} is a list of type \texttt{'a list}
\item Nothing else is a list
\end{itemize}
\item How do we take apart lists? By pattern matching.
\item How do we reason with lists? By induction on the structure of lists
\end{itemize}
\item Infinite Data
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of saying how to construct infinite data, we define it by the observations we make about them
\item Given a stream \texttt{1,2,3,4,5,...} we can ask:
\begin{itemize}
\item The head of the stream: \texttt{1}
\item The tail of the stream: \texttt{2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
\end{itemize}
\item Can we always make an observation? Does this terminate eventually? No, does not terminate.
\begin{itemize}
\item Observations should be productive, shouldn't go into infinite loops. We can make an observation at each step.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Suspending}
\label{sec:org9463217}
How to suspend and prevent evaluation of an expression?
\begin{verbatim}
  type 'a susp = Susp of unit -> 'a

  (* Force evaluation of suspended computation *)
  let force (Susp f) = f ()

(* Example of suspending and forcing computation *)
let x = Susp (fun () -> horribleComp(345)) in force x + force x
\end{verbatim}
Wrap your function in lazy programming so that it suspends computation
\begin{itemize}
\item Infinite Streams: \texttt{type 'a str = \{hd : 'a ; tl : ('a str) susp\}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Encodes a coinductive definition of infinite streams using the two observations \texttt{hd} and \texttt{tl}
\begin{itemize}
\item Asking for the head using the observation \texttt{hd} returns element of type \texttt{'a}
\item Asking for the tail using the observation \texttt{tl} returns a suspended stream of type \texttt{('a str) susp}
\item If you want more elements you need to ask for more
\item Very demand driven
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 26 \textit{<2017-11-10 Fri>}}
\label{sec:org6c025b1}
\subsection{Fundamental Principles in Programming Language Design}
\label{sec:org0fb9733}
Three key questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the syntactically legal expression? What expressions does the parser accept?
\begin{itemize}
\item Grammar
\end{itemize}
\item What are well-typed expressions? What expressions does the type-checker accept?
\begin{itemize}
\item Static semantics
\end{itemize}
\item How is an expression executed?
\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic semantics
\item Why isn't a program working? Seems logically correct, but then how do we delve further?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Definitely need to know the answers to all 3 questions if you're writing a compiler or your own language.
\subsubsection{Syntactically Legal Expressions}
\label{sec:org149962e}
Def. (Not the definition for Ocaml, but similar and essentially for a basic language)

The set of expressions is defined inductively by the following clauses
\begin{enumerate}
\item A number \(n\) is an expression
\item The booleans \texttt{true} and \texttt{false} are expressions.
\item If \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) are expressions, then \(e_1\) op \(e_2\) is an expression where \(op =\{+,=,-,*,<\}\)
\item If \(e\), \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) are expressions, then \texttt{if} \(e\) then \(e_1\) \texttt{else} \(e_2\) is an expression
\end{enumerate}
Example of legal expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{if 3 then 2+3 else 5}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is syntactically fine, but it's a type error
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
When we define languages, we typically have 3 stages: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item source -> lexer -> parser (syntax errors here)
\begin{itemize}
\item After parse, you have an abstract syntax tree
\item How do I read \texttt{3+2=7}? \texttt{(3+2)=7} or \texttt{3+(2=7)}?
\item The definition above is tree like (with the if statements)
\item We won't talk much about parsing and lexing, as most of that has been solved
\end{itemize}
\item -> type checker (if it exists, also type errors are here) -> interpreter \& evaluation (run-time errors/run time exceptions)
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Backus-Naur Form (BNF)}
\label{sec:org5d8d409}
Alternative to the previous definition.

Operations op ::= \(+|-|*|<|=\)

Expressions \(e\) ::= \(n|e_1 \ op \ e_2 | true | false | if \ e \ then \ e_1 \ else \ e_2\)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Representation in OCaml
\label{sec:orgeeb71d1}
\begin{verbatim}
type primop = Equals | LessThan | Plus | Minus | Times

type exp = 
| Int of int (* 0 | 1 | 2 | ... *)
| Bool of bool (* true | false *)
| If of exp * exp * exp (* if e then e_1 else e_2 *)
| Primop of primop * exp list (*e_1 primop e_2 or primop e *)
\end{verbatim}
Example: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{if 3<0 then 1 else 0} is represented as \texttt{If (Primop (LessThan, [Int 3 ; Int 0]), Int 1, Int 0)}
\item \texttt{if true then 3} cannot be represented, no else
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Evaluation}
\label{sec:orga298afa}
How to evaluate an expression?
\begin{itemize}
\item How to describe evaluation of expressions?
\item We want to say: "Expression \(e\) evaluates to a value \(v\)"
\item What are values?
\begin{itemize}
\item Values \(v\) ::= \(n | true | false\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Definition

Evaluation of the expression \(e\) to a value \(v\) is defined inductively by the following clauses:
\begin{itemize}
\item A value \(v\) evaluates to itself.
\item If expression \(e\) evaluates to the value \texttt{true} and expression \(e_1\) evaluates to a value \(v\), then \texttt{if} \(e\) \texttt{then} \(e_1\) \texttt{else} \(e_2\) evaluates to the value \(v\).
\item If expression \(e\) evaluates to the value \texttt{false} and expression \(e_2\) evaluates to a value \(v\), then \texttt{if} \(e\) \texttt{then} \(e_1\) \texttt{else} \(e_2\) evaluates to the value \(v\).
\end{itemize}
Too verbose and doesn't even talk about primitive operators. Need more compact notation.

\(e \Downarrow v\) for "Expression \(e\) evaluates to value \(v\)"

Definition with new notation:

\(e \Downarrow v\) is defined inductively by the following clauses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(v \Downarrow v\)
\item If \(e \Downarrow\) \texttt{true} and \(e_1 \Downarrow v\), then \texttt{if} \(e\) \texttt{then} \(e_1\) \texttt{else} \(e_2 \Downarrow v\)
\item If \(e \Downarrow\) \texttt{false} and \(e_2 \Downarrow v\), then \texttt{if} \(e\) \texttt{then} \(e_1\) \texttt{else} \(e_2 \Downarrow v\)
\end{itemize}

Turning informal description into a formal one
$$\frac{premise_1 \ \ldots \ premise_n}{conclusion}\text{name}$$
Read as: If \(premise_1\) and \(premise_2\) and \(\ldots premise_n\), then conclusion.

$$\frac{}{v \Downarrow v}\text{B-VAL}$$
$$\frac{e \Downarrow true \ e_1 \Downarrow v}{if \ e \ then \ e_1 \ else \ e_2 \Downarrow v}\text{B-IFTRUE}$$
$$\frac{e \Downarrow false \ e_2 \Downarrow v}{if \ e \ then \ e_1 \ else \ e_2 \Downarrow v}\text{B-IFFALSE}$$
Here we only talk about the good things, \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}. We don't define what would happen if \(e \Downarrow\) something else, like a number. Then we would raise not defined.
\section{Lecture 27 \textit{<2017-11-14 Tue>}}
\label{sec:orgda9a92a}
\subsection{Designing our own language}
\label{sec:org09462c7}
(Continuation from last class)

We transformed evaluation into a formal description with premises and a conclusion. Note that evaluation rules do not impose an order on the premises. This works if we don't have state.

Extending further:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \(e_1 \Downarrow v_1\) and \(e_2 \Downarrow v_2\), then \(e_1 \ op \ e_2 \Downarrow v\) where \(v = \overline{v_1 \ op \ v_2}\)
\item \(\frac{e_1 \Downarrow v_1 \ e_2 \Downarrow v_2}{e_1 \ op \ e_2 \Downarrow \overline{v_1 \ op \ v_2}}\) B-OP
\end{itemize}
How to use these rules?
\begin{itemize}
\item Example in slides
\end{itemize}

Our operational semantics (\(e \Downarrow v\)) is what we formalized.

Task: Implement a function \texttt{eval} that does what \(e \Downarrow v\) describes.
\begin{verbatim}
let rec eval e = match e with
| Int _ -> e
| Bool _ -> e
| If (e, e1, e2) ->
    (match eval e with
    | Bool true -> eval e1
    | Bool false -> eval e2
    | _ -> raise (Stuck "guard is not  bool"))
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Why do we care about a formal description?}
\label{sec:org0e706d3}
\begin{itemize}
\item More compact
\end{itemize}
Establish properties and formal guarantees
\begin{itemize}
\item Coverage: For all expressions \texttt{e} there exists an evaluation rule.
\item Determinacy: If \(e \Downarrow v_1\) and \(e \Downarrow v_2\) then \(v_1=v_2\)
\item Value Soundness: If \(e \Downarrow v\) then \(v\) is a value.
\begin{itemize}
\item Should always return a value
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Advantages of an implementation}
\label{sec:org714ddec}
We can run it!
\subsubsection{Static Type Checking}
\label{sec:org76508ca}
\begin{itemize}
\item Types approximate runtime behavior
\item Lightweight tool for reasoning about programs
\item Detect errors statically, early in the development cycle
\item Great for code maintenance
\item Precise error messages
\item Checkable documentation of code
\end{itemize}
How do we make types work?
\begin{itemize}
\item Types classify expressions according to the kinds of values they compute
\begin{itemize}
\item What are values though?
\begin{itemize}
\item Values v ::= n | true | false
\end{itemize}
\item Hence, there are only two basic types.
\begin{itemize}
\item Types T ::= int | bool
\item In OCaml -> ints, floats, functions, unit, ref, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Types
\label{sec:org58ec774}
e:T, expression \(e\) has type \(T\)

Def:
\begin{enumerate}
\item n : int
\item true : bool and false : bool
\item If e : bool and \(e_1:T\) and \(e_2:T\), then if \(e\) then \(e_1\) else \(e_2\) : \(T\)
\item If \(e_1\) : int and \(e_2\) : int, then \(e_1 + e_2\) : int
\item If \(e_1 : T\) and \(e_2 : T\), then \(e_1 = e_2\) : bool
\end{enumerate}
Can be converted to premises
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\frac{}{true:bool}\) T-T
\item \(\frac{}{false:bool}\) T-F
\item \(\frac{e_1:T \ e_2:T}{e_1 = e_2 : bool}\) T-EQ
\item \(\frac{}{n:int}\) T-NUM
\item \(\frac{e_1:int \ e_2:int}{e_1+e_2:int}\) T-PLUS
\item \(\frac{e:bool \ e_1:T \ e_2:T}{if \ e \ then \ e_1 \ else \ e_2:T}\) T-IF
\end{itemize}

Two readings of typing
\begin{itemize}
\item Type Checking \(e:T\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Given the expression \(e\) and the type \(T\), we check that \(e\) does have type \(T\)
\end{itemize}
\item Type Inference \(e:T\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Given the expression \(e\), we infer its type \(T\)
\end{itemize}
\item OCaml does both and well
\item Checking is difficult for us with T-EQ, we don't know what type \(T\) is.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lecture 28 \textit{<2017-11-16 Thu>}}
\label{sec:orgcc1023c}
Extending our language with variables, let-expressions, and functions!
\begin{itemize}
\item Add the following expressions: \(x | let \ x = e_1 \ in \ e_2 \ end\)
\end{itemize}
Are the following well-formed?
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = x in x + 1 end}
\begin{itemize}
\item x is not defined, not well-formed
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = y in x + 1 end}
\begin{itemize}
\item Same problem, y is not defined.
\item Is this equal to the line above? What kind of renaming do we want?
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = 1 in let y = x end in x + y end}
\begin{itemize}
\item Legal
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = 1 in let x = x + 2 end in x + x end}
\begin{itemize}
\item Legal, important to know where things are bound, the first x bounds the \(x\) in \(x+2\). The second let x statement bounds the \(x\) in \(x+x\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Free Variables}
\label{sec:orgf70fe53}
Variable names should not matter

These are all the same: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = 5 in (let y = x + 3 in y + y end) end}
\item \texttt{let x = 5 in (let x = x + 3 in x + x end) end}
\item \texttt{let v = 5 in (let w = v + 3 in w + w end) end}
\end{itemize}

Defining Free Variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(FV(e)\) returns the set of the free variable names occurring in the expression \texttt{e}.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is defined inductively based on the structure of the expression \texttt{e}.
\end{itemize}
\item \(FV(e_1 \ op \ e_2) = FV(e_1) \cup FV(e_2)\)
\item \(FV(n) = \{ \ \}\)
\item \(FV(x) = \{x\}\)
\item \(FV(let \ x = e_1 \ in \ e_2)\)
\item \(FV(e_1) \cup FV(e_1) \setminus \{x\}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{let x = 1 in let y = x+1 end in x+y end}
\begin{itemize}
\item First look at \texttt{x+y} -> x and y are free
\item Now looking at \texttt{let y = x + 1}, \texttt{x} is free here.
\item Apply the function to this let expression, get that \texttt{x} is free
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\{x\} \cup \{x,y\}\setminus \{y\}\)
\end{itemize}
\item Then look at the outer \texttt{let x}. Nothing free there.
\item Apply the function again, get \(\{\} \cup \{x\} \setminus \{x\}\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \(FV(if \ e \ then \ e_1 \ else \ e_2) = FV(e) \cup FV(e_1) \cup FV(e_2)\)
\end{itemize}
In OCaml, \texttt{let}, functions and pattern matching bound variables. In programming languages, no variables should be free, not bound.
\subsection{Substitution}
\label{sec:org1ca3c0e}
Define as: \texttt{[e'/x]e} Replace all \textbf{free} occurrences of the variable \texttt{x} in the expression \texttt{e} with expression \texttt{e'}

Can be read as a function:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: Expression \texttt{e'}, variable \texttt{x}, and expression \texttt{e}
\item Output: an expression where all \textbf{free} occurrences of the variable \texttt{x} in expression \texttt{e} have been replaced by \texttt{e'}
\end{itemize}
Substitution is defined by considering different cases for \texttt{e}.
\end{document}
