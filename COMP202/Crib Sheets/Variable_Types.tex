3. Types
\\ All data manipulated has type, esp. vars
\\ \colorbox{Green}{Primitive types} These don't ref address!
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{int}}: Store integers (32-bit/4 bytes)
%\\ (int overflow) 2147483647+1 gives -2147483648, where -2 gives \ldots 47
\\ \underline{byte}: Int from -128 to 127 (8-bit)
\\ \underline{short}: Int -32,768 to 32767 (16-bit)
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{long}}: Int from $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$ (64-bit)
\\ denoted by L after val (literal), i.e. 3L
%\\ long l=3 does not compile, long l=3L does
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{double}}: Store frac/decim, not inf precision, limited decim
%\\ Write .0 after int, get double | i.e. int x = 3 or double x = 3.0 or double x = 3 (gets evaluated to 3.0)
\\ To store dbl, comp stores 2 ints, int base $*$ $2^{\text{int pow}}$
\\ Rounding issues, limited space
\\ \# finite in base10 may be inf in base-2 i.e. $\frac{1}{10}$
\\ \underline{float}: Smaller double (32 bit instead of 64 bit)
\\ denoted by f, i.e. 3f is float
\\ flt f = 3.0 doesnt compile, flt f=3.0f does
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{boolean}}: Store true/false
\\ boolean aceExam = true; 
\\ Logic ops for bools: \&\&$\rightarrow$ and, ||$\rightarrow$ inclusive or, !$\rightarrow$ not
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{char}}: Store 1 symb (rep by \#)
\\ Litral chars denoted by '', i.e 'M' To store ', write '$\backslash$''
\\ \colorbox{Green}{Reference vs primitive types}
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{Primitive:}} int x=10; $\rightarrow$ 1) mk space in mem to store int, 2) if we use x, want what is there, 3) store 10 in that mem loc
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{Reference:}} int[]x = \{1,2\} $\rightarrow$ 1) mk space in mem to store adrs of array, 2)use x, want to acss space in mem (adrs), 3)Mks array elsewhere in mem that stores 1,2 w/ length 2, must be elsewhere, has adrs a, 4) set val of x to a (adrs)
\\ int[] x = \{1,2\}; int[]y=x; y[0]=2; (x[0]) Will b 2 cuz x \& y pt to same, changing inside what y pts to will change for x too
\\ \colorbox{Green}{Swapping}
\\ Swap prim in other meth, doesnt change in meth that called
\\ Swap ref in another, same thing (cannot change adrs in other meth)
\\ \colorbox{Red}{But} if you change vals pted @ in othr meth, will change vals pted @ in meth
\\ \ldots swap(int[] a, int[] b)\{int temp = a[0]; a[0]=b[0]; b[0]=temp\} Swaps $1^{\text{st}}$ el of both orig arrays but a=b doesnt change anything in meth
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{\underline{String}}: store multiple symbols
\\ Lit strings store in '' '', '' '' is empty string
\\ Can combine strings with ""+""
\\ New line w/ "Bla $\backslash$ n lower bla"
\\ name.length(); for length (diff from arrays, has ())
\\ .charAt(int i);$\rightarrow$ $i^{th}$ symb of String (count from 0)
\\ .substring(a,b)$\rightarrow$gets String from a up to (not incld) b, also .substring(a)$\rightarrow$ a to end
\\ .compareTo(otherStng); $\rightarrow$ Tell which larger
\\ .indexOf(char c);$\rightarrow$ Gives index of $1^{\text{st}}$ c
\\ .toLowerCase();$\rightarrow$ mks new string that is lowercase vers (assn to something)
\\ Can def ur own type!
\\ Store type X in thing of type Y, compiler error
