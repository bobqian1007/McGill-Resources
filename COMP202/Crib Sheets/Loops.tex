8. Loops
\\ \colorbox{Green}{while} Execute forever \underline{while} condition is true
\\ while(cond)\{Keeps happening until false\} Code after only happens once loop done, cond false
\\ Loop counter: int i=0; while(i<5)\{Do something; i++;\} Will do this 5 times
\\ Cond only eval at begin of loop, not after every statement, i.e. can add 10 to i and then subtract 10 from i before loop ends, will still go on
\\ Infinite loops=rip
\\ while(cond); is an infinite loop! Not executing anything
\\ \colorbox{Green}{for} Common loop theme has 3 steps, initialization, iteration (of loop) given condition, finalization
\\ int x = 0; (initialize) while(x<4)(condition)\{Loop action; x++; (finalization at end)\}
\\ for(initialization;condition; finalization)\{loop body\}
\\ initialization happens once, before first step of loop | condition same as while loop | finalization last step of loop (must be a valid statement! i=i+2 instead of i+2)
\\ Copy of while loop: for(int x=0; x<4; x++)\{loop action;\}
\\ Benefits: more readable
\\ \colorbox{Green}{nested loops} Loop inside of another loop
