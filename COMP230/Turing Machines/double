; This program starts on a 1 and doubles the 1
; For every 1, this program writes 2 1s
; The output string is separated by original string by one blank

; Machine starts in state 0.

; State 0: on the first 1
0 1 _ * 1          ; Erase the 1

; State 1: on the blank from 0 go right
1 _ _ r 2  	   ; On a 1, blank and go to state 2

; State 2: Pass all 1s, until we get to a blank
2 1 1 r 2  	   ; Pass 1s
2 _ _ r 3	   ; Go right and to state 3 after passing all 1s

; State 3: Pass all 1s again
3 1 1 r 3  	   ; Pass 1s
3 _ _ * 4	   ; Blank -> state 4

; State 4: Write 1 for all the blanks
4 _ 1 * 4  	   ; Write 1s
4 1 1 r 5	   ; Hit a 1

; State 5: Write a 1 for a blank
5 _ 1 * 6

; State 6: Go left, back through al 1s
6 1 1 l 6
6 _ _ l 7

; State 7: Go left, past all 1s again
7 1 1 l 7
