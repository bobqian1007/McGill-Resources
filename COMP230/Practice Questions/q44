; This program divides an input number by 2

; Machine starts in state 0.

; Start deleting every second 1, starting at the first index
; State 0: 
0 1 _ * 1          ; On a 1, blank and to state 1
0 _ _ r 3	   ; On a blank, go to state 4 to start getting rid of gaps

; State 1: just deleted a 1, go right
1 _ _ r 2  	   ; Go to state 2

; State 2: second 1 (or a blank)
2 _ _ l 3  	   ; On a blank, go to state 3 to start getting rid of gaps
2 1 1 r 0	   ; On a 1, skip it, go right and go to state 0, restarting pair

; State 3: concatenate 1s with blank spaces in between
3 1 _ * 4
