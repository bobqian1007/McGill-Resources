1. Algorithms
\\An \colorbox{Yellow}{algorithm} is a \textbf{systematic} and \textbf{unambiguous} procedure producing an answer to a question/a solution in \colorbox{Yellow}{finite} \textbf{number of steps}.
\\ Algorithm has an input, sometimes, input needs to satisfy conditions. Algorithm has output (usually solution).
\\ \colorbox{Yellow}{Good algorithms} consist of correctness, speed, space \& simplicity. 
\\ Correctness: right answer/right answer most of the time/close to right answer
\\ Space: Amount of mem needed
\\ Simplicity: easy to understand, analyze, implement, debug, modify, update
