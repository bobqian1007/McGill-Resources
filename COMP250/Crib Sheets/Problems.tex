\\ \textbf{List-intersection problem}: input (names of students in COMP250 and names of students in MATH240, no one with same name)
\\ How many are taking both classes? Minimize times to compare?
\\ Can nest for-loops $\to$ \colorbox{Red}{inefficient}
\\ Binary search
\begin{algorithmic}
	\State listIntersection (A,m,B,n)
	\State inter $\gets$ 0
	\State B $\gets$ sort(B,n)
	\For{i $\gets$ $0$ to $m-1$}
		\If{binarySearch(B,n,A[i])} 
			\State inter $\gets$ inter+1
			\EndIf
	\EndFor
	\State return inter
\end{algorithmic}
